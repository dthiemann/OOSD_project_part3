Role: 
Search by prefix. A Field object with ("Word","gr") would return all
the fields with category "Word" that start with the two letters "gr".
Search by suffix. A Field object with ("Word","gr") would return all
the fields with category "Word" that end with the two letters "gr".


Specifications of work to be done:
FieldSearch.java should return all the Field objects which have prefix/suffix matched to value.

Need to find a way to create many types of searches instead of just simple search.

Classes & Interfaces:
Need a class which compares the prefix/suffix and returns found results as list of Strings
Added method in Node to do other kinds of searches

Unit Tests:
PrefixSuffixTest.java
1. Test that it can return for instance, all the fields with category "Word" that start with the two letters "gr"
    can return for instance, all the fields with category "Word" that end with the two letters "gr"
    
2. Test that it displays correct fields that start with "gr" or end with "gr"

3. Test that it can display error message "Field category doesn't exist" when field category can't be found

4. Test that it returns "Fields with prefix 'gr' cannot be found" when fields is null
    returns "Fields with suffix 'gr' cannot be found" when fields is null
