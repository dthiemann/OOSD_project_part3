My role: 
  Create the RESTful interface/web server. May also be doing #3 and or #5 from 
  "enhancements to search engine" list.
  
Specification of work to be done: 
  Research the REST interface and implement it into
  the project. As of now, I plan to use Jersey instead of the Jetty interface but
  until my research is completely done I won't know which one I am more comfortable with.
  I have decided to do use the Jersey API. I have done a lot of research and am still in 
  the process of tying what I have researched to the project. The next step is creating a 
  Dynamic Web Project in Java.

Description of unit test: 
  Test 1-4: Make sure the HTTP methods are functional with the project at both the collection
  level of the resource and the element level. 
  Another test can be done to ensure that the URIs are valid and are able to access the 
  desired data.
